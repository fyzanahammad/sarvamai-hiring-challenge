    "1. youtube-dl: This library is used for downloading videos from YouTube.<br>\n",
    "2. moviepy: Useful for video and audio processing, such as extracting audio tracks from video files.<br>\n",
    "3. torch and transformers: These libraries are needed if you are using PyTorch-based models like Facebook's Wav2Vec for speech-to-text transcription.<br>\n",
    "4. pandas and numpy: Essential for data manipulation and numerical operations.<br>\n",
    "5. scipy and librosa: Used for more detailed audio analysis and processing tasks.<br>\n",
    "6. soundfile: For reading and writing audio files.<br>\n",
    "7. nltk and spacy: Natural Language Processing libraries useful for text manipulation and processing, especially for the semantic chunking.<br>\n",
    "8. gradio: Allows you to create a web interface to easily interact with your models and processes.<br>"
